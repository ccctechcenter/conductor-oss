## Getting Started - Building & Running Conductor
###  Using Docker:
The easiest way to get started is with Docker containers. Please follow the instructions [here](https://conductor.netflix.com/devguide/running/docker.html). 

###  From Source:
Conductor Server is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project and follows all applicable conventions. See instructions [here](https://conductor.netflix.com/devguide/running/source.html).

## Published Artifacts
Binaries are available from the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.netflix.conductor).

Conductor is a platform _originally_ created at Netflix to orchestrate microservices and events.
Conductor OSS is maintained by the team of developers at [Orkes](https://orkes.io/) along with the members of the open source community.

The latest version is [![Github release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/conductor-oss/conductor.svg)](https://GitHub.com/conductor-oss/conductor/releases)
## Conductor OSS
This is the new home for the Conductor open source going forward (previously hosted at Netflix/Conductor).

_The last published version of Netflix Conductor will be **3.15.0** which we will continue to support._

If you would like to participate in the roadmap and development, [please reach out](https://forms.gle/P2i1xHrxPQLrjzTB7).

## Getting Started

### Using Docker (Recommended)
Follow the steps below to launch the docker container:

```shell
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```
* Navigate to http://localhost:5000 once the container starts to launch UI.
* APIs are accessible at http://localhost:8080
* Swagger Docs:http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/api-docs/swagger-config#/

## Database Requirements

* The default persistence used is Redis
* The indexing backend is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (7.x)

## Configuration for various database backends

| Backend        | Configuration                                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redis + ES7    | [config-redis.properties](docker/server/config/config-redis.properties)               |
| Postgres       | [config-postgres.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres.properties)         |
| Postgres + ES7 | [config-postgres-es7.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres-es7.properties) |
| MySQL + ES7    | [config-mysql.properties](docker/server/config/config-mysql.properties)               |

## Other Requirements
* JDK 17+
* UI requires Node 14 to build. Earlier Node versions may work but are untested.

###  Building From Source
If you wish to build your own distribution, you can run ```./gradlew build``` from this project that products the runtime artifacts.
The runnable server is in server/ module.
